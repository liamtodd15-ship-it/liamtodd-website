# Welcome to My Life Blog

I'm going to use this space to share thoughts about  life, building projects in public, and things I'm learning along the way.

## Getting Started

Here are some things I want to write about:

- My daily routines
- Books I'm reading
- Projects I'm working on
- Random thoughts and observations

## Formatting

You can use **bold text** and *italic text* to emphasize things.

You can also add links like this: [Check out my website](https://liamtodd.co.uk)

That's it for now. More posts coming soon!
