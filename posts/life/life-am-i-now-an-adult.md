excerpt: Adult life crept up on me fast, it's kinda nice
---
Driving back from my brothers house, after a day of wedding suit shopping and playing peak-a-boo with my newborn neice, it hit me that I am in the depths of adulthood. I am by no means complaining, the complete opposite in fact.

I'll start out by saying that Bath is pretty rubbish for suit shopping. While yes, it is for a wedding, we did start out with the high street brands. The shiny textures and lack of sizing were initially off putting, but Charles Tyrwhitt provided us with one, pretty good option. Looking for more, we popped our heads into an independent store and it was immediately clear that it was a step up from the ones before. The type of suits that make you feel confident! None were bought today, but it was a good start for a notoriously indecisive groom.

Spending a day with family and being a part of important moments is all that you can ask for in life, and that is what today was.
